# deep-learning-challenge_Module21_Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis
--
* The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. The objective of this analysis is to use machine learning and neural network for the provided dataset, creating a binary classifier that can predict if the applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Steps followed to perform the Analysis
--
* Below is the list of activities performed which would showcase the usage of machine learning and neural network
  * Data Preprocessing Step: Preprocessing the data using pandas and scikit-learn's StarndardScaler()
  * Compile, Train, and Evaluate Step: As next step, compile, train and evaluate the neural network model.

**-- Execute the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb --**
1. Open the Jyupter notebook using visual studio code.
2. Select the correct python environment
3. Click Run all or run each cell in sequence. Please note - running cells in-between or skipping any cell execution might result in error as the variables defined in prior cell might be used. Please run in sequence only.
