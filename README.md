# deep-learning-challenge_Module21_Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis
--
* The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Objective of this analysis is using machine learning and neural network for the provided dataset , creating a binary classifier that can predict if the applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Steps followed to perform the Analysis
--
* Below are the list of activities performed which would showcase the usage of machine learning and nerual network
  * Data Preprocessing Step: Preprocessing the data using pandas and scikit-learn's StarndardScaler()
  * Compile, Train nd Evaluate Step: As next step, compile, train and evaluating the neural network model.
